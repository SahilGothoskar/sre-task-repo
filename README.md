In this project, you'll be tasked with deploying UpCommerce's website as a service on Kubernetes. 
Define alert rules based on key performance indicators (KPIs) like CPU utilisation, memory usage, and request rates, allowing you to detect and respond to potential issues before they affect the user experience. 
Create and deploy these rules using Prometheus. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system designed for containerized environments, such as Kubernetes. 
Collects and stores metrics from various sources, including applications, infrastructure components, and custom exporters, allowing you to monitor the performance and health of your systems in real-time. 
Prometheus uses a powerful query language called PromQL to analyze and visualize the collected metrics, enabling you to gain valuable insights into the behavior of your applications and infrastructure.
